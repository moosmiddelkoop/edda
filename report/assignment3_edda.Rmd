**Introductory description:** To investigate the effect of 3 types of diet, 78 persons were divided randomly in 3 groups, the first group following diet 1, second group diet 2 and the third group diet 3. Next to some other characteristics, the weight was measured before diet and after 6 weeks of diet for each person in the study. The collected data is summarized in the data frame diet.txt with the following columns: person – participant number, gender – gender (1 = male, 0 = female), age – age (years), height – height (cm), preweight – weight before the diet (kg), diet – the type of diet followed, weight6weeks – weight after 6 weeks of diet (kg). Compute and add to the data frame the variable weight.lost expressing the lost weight, to be used as response variable.

Let's start by loading the data and creating a new column containing `weight.lost`, the difference between starting weight and weight after six weeks. If participants actually lost weight, this value will be negative. If they gained weight, this value will be positive.
```{r}
data = read.table('../data/diet.txt', header=TRUE)

weight.lost = data$preweight - data$weight6weeks
data = cbind(data,weight.lost)

pre = data$preweight
post = data$weight6weeks
age = data$age
```

### A
#### Make an informative graphical summary of the data relevant for study of the effect of diet on the wight loss. 

lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

####By using only the columns preweight and weight6weeks, test the claim that the diet affects the weight loss. Check the assumptions of the test applied.

To test this claim, we use a paired t-test. Normality of data is crucial for a correct t-test. We test this assumption by creating a QQplot and performing a shapiro-wilk test. As this is a two-sample t-test, we check normality of the **differences**. If the differences follow a normal distribution, we expect the qqplot to show a linear relation and we expect the null hypothesis of normality to not be rejected by the Shapiro-Wilk test.

```{r}
qqnorm(weight.lost); qqline(weight.lost)
shapiro.test(weight.lost)
```
The results of the plot and the test are in line with our expectations, there is no reason to expect that the differences are not taken from a normal population. We can commence with a paired two-sample t-test.

```{r}
pttest = t.test(pre,post,paired=TRUE)
pttest
```
